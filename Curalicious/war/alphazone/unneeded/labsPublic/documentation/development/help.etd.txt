EnTity Definition (ETD) files contain the description of an entity. 

An entity defintion contains a list of attributes and special control statements. 
There is always one attribute or control statement per line.

An attribute is a field which will be stored with the entity object.
It has the following format "<attributeName>:<datatype> (... @<attributeControl>)"

Possible basic datatypes are: INT, STRING, FLOAT, DOUBLE, USERID, TIMESTAMP
e.g. CreatedOn:TIMESTAMP

A datatype can also be another linked entity. Therefore start with # and enter the name of the linked entity.
e.g. Owner:#Person

Possible attribute control statements are: 
@mandatory -> Field must be provided, e.g. Name:String @mandatory



There are some special control statements, which allow to control the entity:

@AdministrativeData 		    --> Add administrative fields like created on and changed on as well as created by and changed by
@UserSpecific 				    --> Makes the entity user specific, which allows a user to access on his own objects
@API:<method>(, <method> ...) 	--> Automatically adds API function which can be accessed from outside
@ReverseEntity:#<entity>:<RefField>  -->
